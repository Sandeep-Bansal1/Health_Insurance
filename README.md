## Background & Field Research
- <b>Data</b> 
  - According to the centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services:
    - Private health insurance spending grew 5.8 percent to 1,243 billion dollars in 2018.
    - Prescription drug spending increased 2.5 percent to 335.0 billion dollars in 2018, faster than the 1.4 growth in 2017
    - Future predictions are projecting National health spending is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.4 percent for 2019-28 and to reach 6.2 trillion by 2028.
    - More on CDC and heath insurance charges can be found [here](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NHE-Fact-Sheet#:~:text=Private%20health%20insurance%20spending%20grew,the%204.7%25%20growth%20in%202017.)
    
## Buisness Objective Goals </b> 
- Using K-means clustering can a machine learning model accurately reveal the most contributing factor to the costs of health insurance?
