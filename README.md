## Background & Field Research
- <b>Data</b> 
  - According to the centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services:
    - Private health insurance spending grew 5.8 percent to 1,243 billion dollars in 2018.
    - Prescription drug spending increased 2.5 percent to 335.0 billion dollars in 2018, faster than the 1.4 growth in 2017
    - Future predictions are projecting National health spending is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.4 percent for 2019-28 and to reach 6.2 trillion by 2028.
    - More on CDC and heath insurance charges can be found [here](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NHE-Fact-Sheet#:~:text=Private%20health%20insurance%20spending%20grew,the%204.7%25%20growth%20in%202017.)
    
## Buisness Objective Goals </b> 
- Using K-means clustering can a machine learning model accurately reveal the most contributing factor to the costs of health insurance?

## Data:
- By the visual below it is clear that time and money spent have a linear relationship. 
- This dataset has 1338 rows and 7 columns was found from Kaggle which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sriharipramod/knn-k-means)

## Limitations and Future work:

- all the 4 independent variable has a Pvalue of less than 0.05 thus we reject the null hypothesis. and conclude that "Charges" are dependent on the mentioned variables.
- Individuals both female, male and of all ages should keep their BMI at a healthy level, they should not smoke, and should be aware that more children may lead to an increase in health insurance.


## Results and Primary Findings:
- I would have liked to use a linear regression model as well to see if we could make a prediction of future charges based on the data we were given. I do not believe there were any limitations, because it has been reported by CDC that charges have been increasing drastically, and this supports that and also states the reasons as to why it is happening. Ultimately, aging is apart of human process so it is likely to increase in everyone.
