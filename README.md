## Background & Field Research
- <b>Data</b> 
  - According to the centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services:
    - Private health insurance spending grew 5.8 percent to 1,243 billion dollars in 2018.
    - Prescription drug spending increased 2.5 percent to 335.0 billion dollars in 2018, faster than the 1.4 growth in 2017
    - Future predictions are projecting National health spending is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.4 percent for 2019-28 and to reach 6.2 trillion by 2028.
    - More on CDC and heath insurance charges can be found [here](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NHE-Fact-Sheet#:~:text=Private%20health%20insurance%20spending%20grew,the%204.7%25%20growth%20in%202017.)
    
## Buisness Objective Goals </b> 
- Using Logistic Regression can a machine learning model accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?

## Data:
- The worldwide prevalence of DM has risen dramatically over the past two decades, from an estimated 30 million cases in 1985 to 415 million in 2017. According to the article titled "Early onset of type 2 diabetes: risk factorsm clinical impact and management", statistics state the Global estimate for Diabetes Mellitus is approximatly 415 million in 2017. Regional estimates of the number of individuals with diabetes (20â€“79 years of age) are shown (2017).Based on current trends, the IDF projects that 642 million individuals will have diabetes by the year 2040.
